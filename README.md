# Context

This package provides the tools and instructions to use ROS2 on top of DDS-Security.
The security feature is tested across platforms (Linux, macOS, and Windows) as well as across different languages (C++ and Python).

Although we are designing SROS2 to work with any secure middleware, at the moment we are testing with RTI Connext Secure 5.3.1 and eProsima's Fast-RTPS 1.6.0.
If you want to run the demo using RTI Connext Secure you will need a license for it and you will need to install it.
