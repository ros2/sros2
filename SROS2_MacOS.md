# Try SROS2 in MacOS 

## Install OpenSSL

Install a recent version of OpenSSL (1.0.2g or later)

```
brew install openssl
```


## Install ROS2

### Install from binaries 

First install ROS2 from binaries following [these instructions](https://github.com/ros2/ros2/wiki/OSX-Install-Binary)


Setup your environment:
```bash
source . ~/ros2_install/ros2-osx/setup.bash
``` 

In the rest of these instructions we assume that every terminal setup the environment as instructed above.


### Install from source

For OpenSSL to be found when building code you'll need to define this environment variable:
```bash
export OPENSSL_ROOT_DIR=`brew prefix openssl`
```
For convenience you can add this export to your bash_profile.

Install ROS2 from source following [these instructions](https://github.com/ros2/ros2/wiki/Linux-Development-Setup)

Note: Fast-RTPS requires an additional CMake flag to build the security plugins so the ament invocation needs to be modified to pass:
```bash
src/ament/ament_tools/scripts/ament.py build --build-tests --symlink-install --cmake-args -DSECURITY=ON --
```

Setup your environment:
```bash
source ~/ros2_ws/install/setup.bash
``` 

In the rest of these instructions we assume that every terminal setup the environment as instructed above.

## Preparing you environment for the demo

### Create a folder for the files required by this demo

We will now create a folder to store all the files necessary for this demo:

```bash
mkdir ~/sros2_demo
```

### Generating a keystore, keys and certificates

#### Generate a keystore

```bash
cd ~/sros2_demo
ros2 security create_keystore demo_keys
```

#### Generate keys and certificates for the talker and listener nodes

```bash
ros2 security create_key demo_keys talker
ros2 security create_key demo_keys listener
```

### Define the SROS2 environment variables

```bash
export ROS_SECURITY_ROOT_DIRECTORY=$(pwd)/demo_keys
export ROS_SECURITY_ENABLE=true
export ROS_SECURITY_STRATEGY=Enforce
```

These variables need to be defined in each terminal used for the demo. For convenience you can add it to your bash_profile.

## Run the demo

Run the `talker` demo program:

```bash
ros2 run demo_nodes_cpp talker
```

In another terminal (after preparing the terminal as previously described), we will do the same thing with the `listener` program:
```bash
ros2 run demo_nodes_py listener
```

Note: You can switch between the C++ and Python packages arbitrarily.


At this point, your `talker` and `listener` nodes should be communicating securely, using explicit access control lists!
Hooray!
